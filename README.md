# AI Model: KNN and SVM Classification on Iris Dataset

This  demonstrates an implementation of  (KNN)  (SVM) models to classify the Iris dataset. This  involves standardizing features, splitting the data into diffrent sets, and evaluating the performance of both models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
